\subsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_u_t_log_manager}{S\+U\+T\+Log\+Manager}} is used to provide consistent logging convention. 

The logs follow the ML logging convention as well as provides extensive stack trace details when debugging through the shell

~\newline
This class is a singleton logg class which is a wrapper around the Unity\textquotesingle{}s Debug classes. ~\newline
This class provides a standard log format to most of the logs which is consistent with most of our practices at ML. ~\newline
It also extensive stack tracing when debugging using the command shell. ~\newline
This class can also be extended by client applications to add their own functionalities. ~\newline
The most important functionalities are static functions, once extended, we can use the singleton instance to access the extended functionalities.
