This class is a singleton logg class which is a wrapper around the Unity\textquotesingle{}s Debug classes. This class provides a standard log format to most of the logs which is consistent with most of our practices at ML. It also extensive stack tracing when debugging using the command shell. ~\newline
This class can also be extended by client applications to add their own functionalities. The most important functionalities are static functions, once extended, we can use the singleton instance to access the extended functionalities.
